Dear %%RECIPIENT_SCREEN_NAME%%,

A new paper has been accepted: <a href="%%PAPER_URL%%">#%%ARTICLE_ID%% - %%ARTICLE_TITLE%%</a>.

You can therefore choose between the following two status:

1) Ask the author for the sources (article formatted by the journal). In this case, you have to assign this article to a <strong>copy editor</strong> via the «<strong>Assign copy editor</strong>» module.

2) Ask the final version (to be formatted by the author). In this case (if you have not already done so), you must make the journal style files and document preparation rules accessible by following these instructions :

- Combine all these files into a single zipped folder named: <strong>%%REVIEW_CE_RESOURCES_NAME%%</strong>
    - Add this zipped folder to the journal's resources via this link: <a href="%%ALL_REVIEW_RESOURCES_LINK%%">Ressources</a>
